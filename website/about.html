                <h2 class="text-block-subtitle">What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <p class="text-block-p">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible 
                    to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology - a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate 
                    network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them 
                    theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-block-subtitle">Understanding cryptocurrencies</h2>
                <p class="text-block-p">
                    Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for the secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by 
                    ledger entries internal to the system. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, 
                    such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-block-subtitle">Types of cryptocurrency</h2>
                <p class="text-block-p">
                    The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate 
                    cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch.
                    Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto."1﻿ As of Nov. 2019, there were over 18 million bitcoins in circulation 
                    with a total market value of around $146 billion. Some of the competing cryptocurrencies spawned by Bitcoin’s success, known as "altcoins," include Litecoin, Peercoin, 
                    and Namecoin, as well as Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. Today, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence is around $214 billion - Bitcoin currently represents 
                    more than 68% of the total value.
